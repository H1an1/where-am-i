name: owntracks
description: Receive and query GPS location from OwnTracks iOS/Android app via a lightweight HTTP server. Supports named places (home, office, gym), semantic location queries, and location history. Use when the user asks about location tracking, "where am I", GPS awareness, geofencing, or setting up OwnTracks. Triggers on "owntracks", "location", "GPS", "where am I", "位置".

# OwnTracks Location Receiver

Give your AI agent GPS awareness. Zero dependencies, one Node.js file.

## Architecture

```
OwnTracks app → (HTTPS via Cloudflare Tunnel) → server.mjs → data/
                                                         ├── current-location.json
                                                         └── location-log.jsonl
```

## Setup

### 1. Start the receiver

```bash
AUTH_USER=yi AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 24) node scripts/server.mjs
# Default port 8073. Override with PORT=9090
```

Without `AUTH_SECRET`, the server runs open (fine for localhost, not for public URLs).

### 2. Expose via Cloudflare Tunnel

```bash
# Create a tunnel and route DNS
cloudflared tunnel create owntracks
cloudflared tunnel route dns owntracks gps.yourdomain.com

# Create ~/.cloudflared/config.yml:
# tunnel: <tunnel-id>
# credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json
# ingress:
#   - hostname: gps.yourdomain.com
#     service: http://localhost:8073
#   - service: http_status:404

# Run (use http2 if quic is blocked, e.g. in China)
cloudflared tunnel --protocol http2 run owntracks
```

### 3. Configure OwnTracks app

- **Mode:** HTTP
- **URL:** `https://gps.yourdomain.com/`
- **Authentication:** Username + password (matching AUTH_USER / AUTH_SECRET)
- **Monitoring:** Significant (battery-friendly) or Move (precise tracking)

⚠️ OwnTracks may add trailing spaces when pasting passwords. The server trims automatically.

## Named Places

Copy and edit the example:
```bash
cp scripts/places.example.json places.json
# Edit places.json with your locations
```

Format:
```json
{
  "places": [
    { "name": "home", "label": "Home", "lat": 37.775, "lon": -122.419, "radius": 200 },
    { "name": "office", "label": "Office", "lat": 37.790, "lon": -122.389, "radius": 300 }
  ]
}
```

With places configured, queries return semantic locations ("At 家") instead of raw coordinates.

## Querying Location

```bash
# Current location + nearest place
node scripts/query.mjs

# JSON output (for programmatic use)
node scripts/query.mjs --json

# Last N locations
node scripts/query.mjs --history 5

# Locations from a specific date
node scripts/query.mjs --at 2026-03-10

# List configured places
node scripts/query.mjs --places
```

### Direct file access
```bash
cat data/current-location.json          # latest location
tail -5 data/location-log.jsonl         # recent history
```

### Location fields
`lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `acc` (meters), `vel` (km/h), `batt` (%), `conn` (w=wifi, m=mobile), `tid`, `tst` (epoch), `timestamp` (ISO), `receivedAt` (ISO).

## Use Cases for Agents

- **Context awareness:** "You're still at the office at 11pm — time to head home?"
- **Proactive help:** Detect arrival at airport → check flight status
- **Smart home:** Detect "at home" → trigger automations
- **Daily journaling:** Log places visited with timestamps
- **Safety:** Alert if no location update for extended period

## Nearby Search (AMap/高德)

Requires `AMAP_API_KEY` env var. Get a free key at https://lbs.amap.com

```bash
# Auto-uses current GPS location
node scripts/nearby.mjs "咖啡"

# Custom radius and explicit coordinates
node scripts/nearby.mjs "餐厅" --radius 1000 --lat 37.775 --lng -122.419

# JSON output for programmatic use
node scripts/nearby.mjs "药店" --json

# Limit results
node scripts/nearby.mjs "便利店" --limit 5
```

Combines with GPS: if OwnTracks is running, nearby search auto-detects your location. No need to pass coordinates.

**Use cases:** restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, hospitals, transit, gyms — anything in AMap's POI database (excellent coverage in China).
